# unfinished-autoencoder
current state of autoencoder, not yet finished

Hi

I just uploaded the scripts as is, I apologize if it is a bit messy. 

autoencoder_test. py : for-loops runs a bunch of times and saves the result for visual inspection
autoencoders.py : different configurations of autoencoders to be tested in -_test-script.
autoencoder.py :  first autoencoder
random_plotting : plots of the leaks



best, Magnus
